                What is Bitcoin?<br><br>
                </div>

                <div class="info">
                In short, Bitcoin is a electronic payment system based on mathematical proof.<br><br>
                The digital currency is decentralized and independent of any central authority or bank. Using peer-to-peer technology with transactions and the issuing of Bitcoin to be carried out collectively by the network. Balances are stored on a public ledger in the cloud and Bitcoin transactions are verified by computing power in the form of miners.<br><br>
                Proposed in 2008 by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, who's identity has still yet to be discovered. The white paper outlined a borderless payment system which promised low fees, fast transactions and the freedom of money.<br><br>
                Bitcoin differs from fiat money in several important ways:<br><br>

                <div class="info">
                1. Decentralised<br>

                Bitcoin is a distributed and open network, owned by nobody. This makes the digital currency decentralized and means no single authority, bank or institution controls the network. Bitcoin is maintained by volunteer coders and run by an open network of dedicated computers spread around the world. Giving individuals and groups back control over their money<br><br>

                <div class="info">
                2. Fixed Supply<br>

                Based on the concept of gold being mined. Bitcoin also has a maximum limit of 21 million which can be in existence. This is to counter the manipulation and inflammatory nature of fiat currency. The idea is that over time, bitcoins mined will decrease and thus become scarcer over time. In theory this will intern increase the demand.<br><br>

                <div class="info">
                3. Anonymity<br>

                Unlike traditional payments, in theory. Bitcoin users are semi-anonymous, as there is no central validator requiring users to identify themselves when making a transaction. In practise to stop criminals, terrorists and money-launderers most exchanges are required by law to perform identity checks on customers. Transactions can be tracked with wallet addresses and linked to users in most cases.<br><br>

                <div class="info">
                4. Fixed Transactions<br>

                Unlike electronic fiat transactions, Bitcoin cannot be reversed. As a transaction is recorded on the network, and if more than an hour passes, it is impossible to modify as there is no central body. Whilst this may discourage some, it does make sure transactions cannot be tampered with.<br><br>

                <div class="info">
                5. Divisibility<br>

                Due to Bitcoin be based on mathematical protocols, making it possible to complete micro transactions. Not possible in current electronic money. The smallest unit is one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin (0.00000001) and called a satoshi.<br><br>
