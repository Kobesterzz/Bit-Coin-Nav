                    What is Bitcoin?<br><br>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info">
                    In short, Bitcoin is a electronic payment system based on mathematical proof.<br><br>
                    The digital currency is decentralized and independent of any central authority or bank. Using peer-to-peer technology with transactions and the issuing of Bitcoin to be carried out collectively by the network. Balances are stored on a public ledger in the cloud and Bitcoin transactions are verified by computing power in the form of miners.<br><br>
                    Proposed in 2008 by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, who's identity has still yet to be discovered. The white paper outlined a borderless payment system which promised low fees, fast transactions and the freedom of money.<br><br>
                    Bitcoin differs from fiat money in several important ways:<br><br>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info">
                    1. Decentralised<br>

                    Bitcoin is a distributed and open network, owned by nobody. This makes the digital currency decentralized and means no single authority, bank or institution controls the network. Bitcoin is maintained by volunteer coders and run by an open network of dedicated computers spread around the world. Giving individuals and groups back control over their money<br><br>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info">
                    2. Fixed Supply<br>

                    Based on the concept of gold being mined. Bitcoin also has a maximum limit of 21 million which can be in existence. This is to counter the manipulation and inflammatory nature of fiat currency. The idea is that over time, bitcoins mined will decrease and thus become scarcer over time. In theory this will intern increase the demand.<br><br>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info">
                    3. Anonymity<br>

                    Unlike traditional payments, in theory. Bitcoin users are semi-anonymous, as there is no central validator requiring users to identify themselves when making a transaction. In practise to stop criminals, terrorists and money-launderers most exchanges are required by law to perform identity checks on customers. Transactions can be tracked with wallet addresses and linked to users in most cases.<br><br>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info">
                    4. Fixed Transactions<br>

                    Unlike electronic fiat transactions, Bitcoin cannot be reversed. As a transaction is recorded on the network, and if more than an hour passes, it is impossible to modify as there is no central body. Whilst this may discourage some, it does make sure transactions cannot be tampered with.<br><br>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info">
                    5. Divisibility<br>

                    Due to Bitcoin be based on mathematical protocols, making it possible to complete micro transactions. Not possible in current electronic money. The smallest unit is one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin (0.00000001) and called a satoshi.<br><br>

                <div>

                    <div class="info">
                        Once you have purchased your Bitcoin, you will want the digital asset to be stored in a safe place. In this section we will provide a description of cryptocurrency wallets and information on different wallets that can be used.<br><br>

                        In simple terms a cryptocurrency wallet allows users to store and retrieve their digital assets. <br><br>
                        
                        
                        
                        From a technical standpoint Bitcoin is digital and not stored in a physical place like cash or gold. However the aspects which are stored are the <br>
                        public addresses and secret digital keys. A cryptocurrency wallet uses a software program that stores public address and private keys. Which <br>
                        interacts with various blockchain to enable users to access and make transactions with their digital currency.<br><br>
                        
                        
                        
                        From a user perspective a cryptocurrency wallet is equivalent to a physical wallet and you will be able to make transactions and monitor your <br>
                        balance. It is important to know the different types of wallets in order to keep your Bitcoin and other digital assets safe. These can be found <br>

                        Bitcoin through Binance, Coinbase etc, the stored currency is in an online wallet.<br><br>
                        

                        The method means users have easy access to their funds however it is controlled by a third party. It is important to make sure the exchange or <br>

                        This makes them still at risk from online hacks however they are more secure as they are controlled by the you, the user.<br>

                        Paper<br>
                        Essentially a document with your public address and private keys written on. It often has a QR code on that can be scanned for quick access and <br>
                        transactions.<br><br>
                        
                        A benefit of this method is the information is stored offline however you are printing valuable information and should make sure it is kept in a <br>
                        safe place where only you have access.<br><br>
                        
                        Physical Bitcoin<br><br>
                        
                        It is now possible to have a “physical Bitcoin” (as such). It is a glamorous way of having your public address and public keys written down. There <br>
                        are different types but they all work similarly with information hidden under a reelable hologram and when removed, it leaves a tamper evident <br>
                        mark. Once the physical Bitcoin is redeemed it looses its digital worth<br><br>
                        
                        They have become more like a collectors item and like paper wallets are offline so makes them immune to online hacks however they need to <br>
                        be stored in a safe place.

                <div id="IntroToMargin" class="title">Introduction to Margin Trading</div> <br>
                <div>
                    <div class="info">
                        Margin trading accounts allow traders to access greater sums by “borrowing” capital. This enhances a traders <br>
                        buying power enabling traders to open position far larger than their real account balance. It also allows traders to long and short the market, which means traders can profit in <br>
                        both a bullish and bearish market.<br><br>
    
                        Margin trading is also referred to as leverage trading. Leverage is the amount by which a trader is able to multiply their position. This usually <br>
                        ranges between 1X to 100X leverage.<br><br>

                        An example of using 100X leverage: If a trader uses a margin of $36 with 100X leverage. On a margin trading platform this enables you trade<br>
                        $36 X 100, which would give you $3,600 worth of Bitcoin contracts.<br><br>

                        Whilst this can be a great method to amplify profits. It is risky and exposes a trader to heavy losses. It is recommended to trade within 0 - 25X <br>
                        leverage.<br><br>

                        Margin trading is possible as the trader puts down an “ initial margin” on a trade and is required to keep a certain amount of capital in their <br>
                        account, called the “maintenance margin”. If a position is suffering a loss, you might become "liquidated". This where the loss on the position <br>
                        is approaching or becomes equal to the initial margin you committed to the position. This alongside the maintenance margin ensures your <br>
                        account does not go into negative funds.<br><br>

                        When opening a position on a margin platform you can either go long or short. If you believe the digital asset will rise you will open a long <br>
                        position. If you wish to profit from the digital asset going down in price , you will open a short position. <br><br>

                        We have reviewed and outlined the best Bitcoin margin trading platforms here.<br><br>

                    Unfortunately scams are common in the digital spaced it is important to keep your personal details and funds safe. We want to help users <br>
                    navigate the cryptocurrency space with ease but we want to make sure all users are doing this safely. Below is a few guidelines to raise your <br>
                    awareness of measures you can take to ensure that you do not fall victim to a scam:<br><br>

                    Make sure all websites you visit have a SSL certificate. This means that all passwords and information inputted on the website will be encrypted.<br>
                    An SSL certificate is a secure padlock in the browser.<br><br>

                    Unless you are signed up to a website mailing list or have listed an account with an exchange. It is unlikely that a website, exchange, influencer <br>
                    etc will reach out to you first. Especially with requests to deposit funds to unsolicited deposit addresses.<br><br>

                    Always check rewards or promotions on the companies website. Nobody can offer “guaranteed profits”.<br><br>

                    Always check the email domain. For instance BitcoinNav email will end in “@bitcoinnav.com”.<br><br>

                    Never reveal your public keys to anybody. If you are to transfer digital coins to an address, this does not require you to release your private key <br>
                    information. You will only need the public address of the intended recipient of the digital coins.<br><br>

                    We highly recommend setting up 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) when using exchanges. 2FA is a method in which you are only able to gain <br>
                    access after successful inputting the generated numbers. Often used with SMS, email or google authenticator. This further protects your <br>
                    accounts.<br><br>

                    Finally, if something seems to good to be true. Chances are it is.<br><br>

                    We hope this helps you to stay safe when navigating the cryptocurrency space. We are happy to answer in questions, which can be done by <br>
